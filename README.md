In this project I will:
	Display a welcome message to the player.
	Store a random number as a solution.
	Prompt the player for a guess.
	Provide a hint for the player - either "it's lower" or "it's higher".
	Once the guess is correct stop looping and inform the user that they are correct.
	Display statistical data to the user after completion.
